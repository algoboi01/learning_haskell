# Learning Haskell

This is me learning Haskell by doing problems and projects. 
Here you can find programs that I write while learning concepts and syntax of the language.
Maybe you can find a code snippet in this repo which might be useful to you or might encourage you to start learning Haskell as well.

This is an ongoing learning experience and the repo will be updated with new projects and problem solutions. You may find some files or folders empty or non-working code.

To know more and get started with Haskell, vist https://www.haskell.org/

Below is the list and gist of each folder contents.

## CIS194_Homework

Homework problem solutions from the course CIS 194 taught at UPenn. (Entirely my solutions)

Course Website : https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/

## HTML_Blog

Implementation of a simple static blog generator in Haskell, converting documents written in our own custom markup language to HTML.

Tutorial/Docs Link : https://lhbg-book.link/

## JSON_Parse

Writing a JSON Parser from scratch in Haskell.

Tutorial/Docs Link : https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/json-parsing-from-scratch-in-haskell/

## Blockchain

Implementation of concepts of a blockchain from scratch in Haskell.
I also have done this in python. (Very simple implementation of proof of work)

## LearnYouHaskell

Code snippets and exercise solutions from the book "Learn You Haskell for Greater Good" by  Miran Lipovaƒça 

Link to the book website : http://learnyouahaskell.com/

## projectEuler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 
Providing all solutions in Haskell from scratch. (Might not be efficient but anyways)

Link to Project Euler website : https://projecteuler.net/about

## simplePrograms

This is where my debug code is. Here I put down the code which I find on the web while learning any concept or function declarations before appending them to the actual project or solution.
Also this contains code snippets which can be useful in further projects.
Also contains useless code sometimes.
